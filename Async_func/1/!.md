Synchronous vs. Asynchronous
Synchronous: Each line of code waits for the previous line to finish before moving on. This can block the program, especially when operations take time, like network requests or file I/O.
Asynchronous: Tasks can start and finish independently. While one task is waiting to complete, the program can move on to execute other code.

An async function in JavaScript is a special type of function that allows you to work with asynchronous code more easily. When you declare a function with the async keyword, it automatically returns a Promise and can use the await keyword within it, which makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code.

Here’s a quick breakdown of async functions:

async Keyword: Declaring a function as async means it will always return a Promise, even if you return a non-promise value inside it. If a promise is returned, it will "unwrap" it, meaning you don’t have to manually handle it outside the function.

await Keyword: Inside an async function, you can use await to pause the function until a promise settles (either fulfilled or rejected). This lets you handle asynchronous code sequentially, as if it were synchronous.

Example

async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data'); // Pause until promise is resolved
    const data = await response.json(); // Pause until data is converted to JSON
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  }
}

fetchData(); // Calls the async function

Promise 

A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and the resulting value. Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more manageable way, allowing you to execute code once an operation has completed successfully or handle any errors if it fails.

Promise States
A promise has three possible states:

Pending: The initial state, meaning the operation hasn't completed yet.
Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and a result is available.
Rejected: The operation failed, and an error is available.
Basic Usage
To create a promise, you use the new Promise constructor, passing it a function with resolve and reject parameters.

resolve: Call this function when the operation is successful.
reject: Call this function if there's an error.
Example
javascript
Copy code
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const success = true;

  if (success) {
    resolve("Operation completed successfully!");
  } else {
    reject("There was an error.");
  }
});

// Using the promise
myPromise
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // Logs: "Operation completed successfully!"
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error); // If rejected, logs: "There was an error."
  });
