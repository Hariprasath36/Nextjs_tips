HMR, or Hot Module Replacement, is a feature that allows you to update modules in a web application without needing a full page reload. This is especially useful in development because it speeds up the feedback loop by only reloading or replacing parts of the code that have changed. In the context of JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, and even build tools like Webpack or Vite, HMR enables a smoother and faster development experience by keeping the application state intact while you make code changes.
